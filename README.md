# Online Flight Booking
The website provides a convenient platform for users to book tickets for various available flights. With our intuitive user interface, customers can easily select and book multiple tickets for their desired flights.

Once the booking process is completed and payment is made, the system generates an electronic ticket (e-ticket) for the user. This e-ticket serves as a digital confirmation of their booking and contains all the relevant details, such as flight information, departure and arrival cities, departure and arrival times, and the total price.

By utilizing the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern, the website ensures a well-organized and efficient structure. The models handle the data representation, including flights and bookings. The views handle the logic and interactions with the users, allowing them to browse available flights, book tickets, and initiate the payment process. Finally, the templates provide the user interface, displaying the flight options, booking forms, and e-ticket download functionality.

Through this seamless integration of functionality and design, the website streamlines the ticket booking process, making it hassle-free for users to plan their travel and conveniently access their e-tickets.
